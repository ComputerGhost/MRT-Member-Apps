PASSED:

	SQL injection

	Javascript injection to change IP
	Insert javascript code into application so review runs code

	TOR proxy
		- Tested last week

	DoS attack
		- Decreases bandwidth used for DoS attacks

FAILED:

	Http proxy
		- False positives

	Submitting from another site and changing info
		- We could fix this, but it's just like doing an ordinary submission, and changing IP is still detected. So...  probably not worth fixing.  It's okay.

TO BE TESTED:

	Caching proxy

	Viewing files on server

	Registering under another user's name and ruining rep
